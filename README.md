# NeuralNetwork
A simple neural network generator and trainer.  Example uses are provided in example package.

The purpose of this project was to see if I could create my own neural network from scratch and understand all of the math necessary.  If you are serious about pursuing artificial intelligence through neural networks, I would suggest using Google's TensorFlow library or something similar.
